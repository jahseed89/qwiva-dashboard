## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

## Login and Sign up


The application is entirely operational starting from the login page. Users will only gain access to the dashboard upon fulfilling the necessary requirements specified in the error messages. This principle applies to the signup page as well. Moreover, the application is fully responsive.

## Dashboard and Side navigation

Upon logging in, the dashboard serves as the main landing page. Users have the capability to navigate through various routes from the side navigation and remain active on the selected route.

## Other functionalities

The application incorporates all essential functionalities according to its intended flow.

## Hosted Site

For test cases on both mobile and other devices, I have also hosted the application for testing purposes. Below is the hosted link:
